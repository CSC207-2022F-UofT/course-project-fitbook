# Fitbook

Fitbook is a web application for users to share and see each other's exercise routines! The goal of this project is to provide users the opportunity to share exercise routines that they have found success with, and to take inspiration from others!

Throughout the development, our team has faced many obstacles trying to get all of the features working for Fitbook to combine into a smooth experience for users to share and be guided by the experiences of others. Fitbook provides you with multiple features to allow you to interact with and take inspiration from the many users of Fitbook.

Fitbook allows you to:

 - Create an account and login/register!
 - View a personalized feed of user's post when you enter the app!
 - Make your own posts to share with other users!
 - Like/upvote the posts of users' that you've found useful or enjoyed!
 - Keep track of your posts and those you've liked!
 - Search for posts of interest based on the exercises' keywords!
 - Follow users' who interest you, and build a following!
 - View your own and other users' profiles!

# Getting Started
Fitbook requires Java 11, which can be installed [here](oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).

Fitbook is a Spring application that runs on the **web**, where you can login/register, view and upvote posts, follow users, search for posts, create posts, and more!

To run the Spring application, first clone this GitHub repository to wherever you desire on your computer!

```shell
cd ~/PROJECT_REPOSITORY_LOCATION
git clone https://github.com/CSC207-2022F-UofT/course-project-fitbook.git
```

Next, open the project in your favourite code editor!

After doing so, open the file, course-project-fitbook/src/main/java/ca/utoronto/fitbook/FitbookApplication.java. Right click on the FitbookApplication file and click on `Run FitbookApplication.main()` and run the main method!

By default, the website should be using port 8080. so access it by entering http://localhost:8080 in your web browser of choice!

Welcome to Fitbook!
